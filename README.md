# Lash-Test
# This program originated in finding lash for Ford parts. Ford determined that lag was not as important as they originally thought, but we kept the program in case that
# changed. As I am not fully versed in Python, the code may look clumsy. I have three different scripts that are called in the main script. 
# File_Info.py pulls the information from the original data set.
# num_runs.py determines how many runs there are within a given test.
# New_Excel_Creator.py creates the new Excel file and occupies the cells.
# Lash_Plot_Main.py brings it all together and plots the point of supposed lash.
